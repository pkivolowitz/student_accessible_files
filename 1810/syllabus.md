## CS – the best field ever!

Of course, I am biased.

From the age of 13 (in 1974) I was totally, completely and irrevocably hooked. It has been a wild, challenging and rewarding ride for me. When I sat in your chair I had no idea I’d have a career at the leading edge of motion picture visual effects. I had no idea I’d win an Academy Award (and my software win a second). I had no idea I’d start five businesses. I had no idea I’d...

This concept of “I had no idea I’d…” is a great selling point of CS. Ask yourself, what field doesn’t have an underpinning in computers. Suppose you have a passion for, well, anything – you can apply CS to it! If you have a passion for Anthropology to Zoology (and every letter in between), you can combine that passion with CS.

## Principles of Computer Science I

This course is for intended majors and minors.

Our course CSC 1100 is more appropriate for people who know they are going to take one and only one CS course. If this is you, consider 1100.

## C or Better

You must achieve a C or better to go on to the next course in our introductory sequence. A C- or below permits you to repeat / delete. However, the loss of a semester throws you out of sync with the department’s schedule. Only you are responsible for your grade.

## Crunchy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside

I’m born and raised a New York City boy. I’ve started businesses. I’ve hired people. I’ve fired people. Put this all together and it says “I speak plainly.” I speak from the perspectives of instructor, mentor and as an employer.

These perspectives can lead to more plain talk than you might be accustomed to from the many fantastic professors here at Carthage. I hope you will come to see my plain talk as part of the value I bring to the classroom.

I might at times present a crunchy exterior but be assured there is a soft and chewy inside. I always have your interests at heart. Helping you achieve success is my first and foremost goal.

With that said, I am a fanatic for *code quality*. Software kills. Always remember that. Code like someone's life depends on it.

[Example 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25)

[Example 2](https://www.businessinsider.com/boeing-outsourced-737-max-report-2019-6)

You might say: "Yeah, but I'll never write avionics or medical instrument software"...

[Example 3](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/04/30/twenty-indian-students-commit-suicide-inaccurate-university/)

**Software kills.**

**Programmers are new guardians of public safety, the environment and the future of human kind. No joke.**

## A comment about equity and inclusion

I completely subscribe and agree with the Carthage statements on equity and inclusion. See them [here](https://www.carthage.edu/equity-inclusion/mission-statement/).

## Practice, Practice, Practice

You’re on a team? There’s hell to pay if you miss a practice, right?

You’re in the choir? Not for long if you don’t rehearse.

You play an online video game? Without practice you’re the first to be fragged.

CS is no different. 
You cannot succeed in CS without practice.

CS is no different from any endeavor in which you seek excellence. What you do outside the classroom strongly indicates the degree to which you will succeed in a career that is CS-centric.

If you don’t practice your sport, the consequences are immediate - you don’t play.

If you don’t practice CS the consequences are delayed and potentially more damaging and lasting. Keep in mind that a low grade (C- or lower) will prevent you from advancing to the next course in our introductory sequence. If CS is to be your major or minor, this can be a big, big deal.

Consider these questions:

* Are you likely to put food on your family’s table with your optional activities?
* Does the sport you play have a nice retirement plan? Drug plan? Vision?
* Will League of Legends pay for your kid’s orthodontia?

If you have to blow off something, make sure it isn’t YOUR MAJOR.

## At the end of this course you will be able to…

You’ll have a platform on which to build future learning. At the end of this course you will have gained broad exposure to C and C++. You will master selection, looping, procedural organization (functions) and will be familiar with structs and classes. You will have used nearly all key words in the language.

Other “high concepts” that you will work towards include:

* Thinking algorithmically
* Recognizing and appreciating certain immutable laws in the CS universe such as the constant never-ending struggle between time and space. Yes, really.

## Why we use C & C++

There is a Gulliverian debate about the choice of first programming language. Truly, it has taken on a religious cast with zealots advocating any number of “right” choices. We use C++. We use C++ because it’s hard (so learning other languages in the future is made less difficult), it’s foundational (being a derivative of C many languages are similar to C++), it’s employable and other reasons.

## Platform

We will be using the Unix (Linux) command line on Windows and the Terminal on the Mac. Our code editor will be Visual Studio Code. 

This means, for owners of Windows devices, you must have the latest updates of Windows 10. 

On the Mac, requirements are less stringent – having a recent Mac OS is satisfactory. 

If you have Linux, that’s fine too. 

If you insist upon using xcode on the Mac or Visual Studio (not to be confused with Visual Studio Code), you will run into difficulty. You are warned.

## Accessing Schoology

You are required to be up-to-date on any announcements or postings on our class learning management system whether or not said announcement is made in class.

## Accessing the Class Text

The text is an online service hosted at zyBooks.com. Of particular note is that being online, it offers live exercises within the “book” that give immediate feedback. These exercises are graded. They are in general, straight forward. Not doing these is like tossing your grade in the trash as the readings account for a large part of your grade.

1. Sign in or create an account at learn.zybooks.com
2. Enter zyBook code: CARTHAGECSC1810KivolowitzFall2019
3. Subscribe

Note: this is REQUIRED.

## Class Rhythm

I begin every class with as much review (within reasonable time) as you require.

Readings will be assigned from zybooks on most class days. Readings are due by the next class meeting. This means less time to do readings assigned on Tuesdays. Remember that readings play a big part in the computation of final grade.

In *general*, we will follow this pattern:

### Tuesdays

* Review, new material and exercises.
* Projects that are due the following week are (explained and) assigned.
* Projects assigned the week before are due by end of this day (11:55 PM).
* zybook homework assigned.

### Thursdays

* Review and exercises.
* Some new materials.
* zyBook homework assigned.

## Note about missing class

Tell coaches / group leaders that students who miss CSC 1810 typically do poorly.

Reminder, you need a C or better to continue with the major or minor. As indicated earlier, if something has to give - it should NOT be your major. 

Again, the C or better requirement to advance in the CS major (and minor) must be stressed. 

If you imagine reaping the rich lifetime of rewards as a high priest or priestess of technology, why would you put it at risk?

## Course components / grading

I stress these can change as I adapt to class needs.

| Component | Weight |
| -- | -- |
| Midterm | 10 |
| Final exam | 15 |
| Programming Assignments | 50 |
| zybooks readings / exercises | 25 |

Notice how much the readings count. Don't blow them off.

Quizzes may be frequent. Or they may not. To the degree they are given, they are not graded. Consider these practice for the midterm and final.

Each assignment is graded on a numeric scale without curve. Your final grades may be curved modestly. Typically, if I apply a curve, raw composite grades are raised to the power of 0.8.

**REMEMBER THAT THE LMS GRADE WILL NOT INCLUDE THE CURVE (IF A CURVE IS APPLIED).
BEING AN EXPONENTIAL BOOST, STUDENTS AT THE TOP AND BOTTOM WILL BE HELPED THE LEAST.**

Any differences between your final grade and that which you see on the LMS will be zero to positive – that is, your final grade will be the same or higher than what you see on Schoology, never lower.

## Programming assignments

A number of programming assignments will be assigned. Each will be due in one week. Projects may be turned in one day late with a 10 percent penalty.

Programming assignments will be graded on a 100-point scale.

Projects have specifications. Read specifications immediately. If anything in a specification is unclear, ask for resolution immediately. I prefer this sort of question be asked in a class so that all may benefit.

You are to hand in only source code.

Your name must be at the top of every file.

You will learn what a “warning” is - having just one is an instant 10 point deduction.

## Exams

There will be a midterm and a final. Both will be closed book. You may prepare a 3 inch by 5 inch index card (both sides) with notes. See below. No electronic devices of any kind will be permitted during exams. The final is cumulative. Both exams will be administered on paper. Please advise me as soon as possible if you are eligible to take the exam at the testing center.

It is possible exams will include multiple choice questions in addition to more complex written answer questions.

The class meeting immediately before an exam is for review. You guide this review. I will not present any material which is not prompted by your questions so come prepared. If you ask a question that I know to be in the exam, I will give you a “perfect” answer – i.e. I will not hold back.

## Note about note cards

You are permitted one 3” x 5” index card (both sides) of notes during the midterm and exam. In my experience, the note card does not help during the exam. Creating the card is what helps. You will have to think about where you feel you’re weakest. Then, you’ll make notes on these topics. The act of making the notes is where I think you’ll get the most benefit.

## Note about cramming

* Cramming before a test in this course won’t work.
* Cramming before a test won’t work in this course.
* In this course, cramming for a test won’t work.
* It won’t work in this class to cram for a test.

I could do this all day. **PRACTICE**, coming to class and doing the work will work. Nothing else.

## Computers in class

Bring your computer to every class. 

When we are practicing, your computers will be on, in use, and running only software relevant to the classwork.

A “good” computer is recommended. Sometimes, for various reasons, a student may not be in possession of a “good” computer. This puts the student at a disadvantage. If this is you, please see me as I might be able to help.

If you are buying a laptop for college the most important thing is that it has an SSD – spinning disks are too slow and fragile. Next, lots of memory (8 GB or more). Then I would shop on weight and battery life. A larger screen is good but large screens make for a heavier laptop – a conundrum. You should have at least a Core i5.

## Advising and accommodations

The Carthage Advising Center offers a variety of services and accommodations to students with disabilities, based on appropriate documentation, nature of disability, and academic need. In order to initiate services, students should meet with Diane Schowalter at the start of the semester to discuss reasonable accommodation. After meeting with Diane Schowalter, students in need of accommodations should also speak with individual faculty members from whom accommodations are sought to communicate their needs and make requests in a timely manner. If a student does not request accommodation or provide documentation, the faculty member is under no obligation to provide accommodations. You may contact Diane Schowalter at ext. 5802 or via e-mail at dschowalter1@carthage.edu.

## A note about accessibility

Carthage College strives to make all learning experiences as accessible as possible. If you anticipate or experience academic barriers due to your disability (including mental health, learning disorders and chronic medical conditions), please let me know immediately so that we can privately discuss options.  To establish reasonable accommodations, you also need to register with Diane Schowalter in Learning Accessibility Services (dschowalter1@carthage.edu).

## Academic Success and Health

Good health can help you achieve academic success. The Health and Counseling Center (HCC) supports students by addressing physical, mental, and emotional well-being. All services are free and confidential and are provided by experienced and licensed professionals. Services are available to all full-time, undergraduate students.

* https://www.carthage.edu/campus-life/health-counseling/
* Mon-Fri 8:00am-4:00pm

## Attendance policy

Discussed above. Miss class at your peril. You are expected to attend every class in its entirety. If you must miss class:

1. Be sure you connect with someone who was there for notes and discussion.
2. Let me know in advance. Do not give a reason.

## Academic Honesty Guidelines

Carthage College Academic Honesty Guidelines are found [here](https://www.carthage.edu/community-code/academic-concerns/academic-honesty-guidelines/).

TL;DR

| Topic	| Summary |
| -- | -- |
| Plagiarism | Don’t do it |
| Cheating on a Test | Don’t do it |
| False Citation | Don’t do it |
| Multiple Submissions | Don’t do it |
| False Data | Don’t do it|

Here’s a simple rule. You can talk about strategy and concept. You can’t look at code.

Folks, it is really easy for me to spot copied code. I have detected and prosecuted Academic Honesty violations to their undesirable end-state. Don’t try me.

With that said, this is your first course and your projects won’t have many significantly different solutions. Therefore, I won’t be trying very hard to identify copied code in this class.

Even so, here’s the thing: If you cheat, you cheat yourself. Someone is paying a boatload of money for you to be here (thank them!). You owe it to them and your current and future selves to be the best you can be. Cheating does not help you. 

**COME TO ME FOR HELP – OR THE TUTORS – IT IS YOUR PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY TO AVOID FEELING IT NECESSARY TO CHEAT. DON’T PUT YOURSELF IN THAT PREDICAMENT IN THE FIRST PLACE!**

## My office hours

I no longer post office hours because these work out to be constraining to students. Instead, I am available for drop-in or by appointment. This works out better for **you**.

Please come any time. If I can talk, I’ll talk.

To make an appointment use Google Calendar. You have access to it – we all do. Select show co-worker’s schedule and enter pkivolowitz. When my schedule is visible, pick a blank spot. Click on the blank spot you want and enter an informative title and adjust the time carefully. THEN MAKE SURE YOU SEND ME AN INVITATION. Do this by entering my email address where guests are specified. Make sure you click the “send invitation” button shown to you when you’ve saved the meeting.

## Preferred means of contacting me

Email.

## Possibility of changes made to the course

Please note the above schedule, policies, procedures and assignments in the course are subject to change in the event of extenuating circumstances, by mutual agreement and / or to encourage better student outcomes.

## Concerning learning outcomes

Students may vary in their competency levels of any stated outcome. Students can expect to achieve stated outcomes only if they honor all course policies, attend classes regularly, complete all assigned work in good faith and on time and meet all other course expectations of them as students.

## Suggestions for how to do well in all CS courses

Here are suggestions that are always sound:

* **Start Early**
* **Work Steadily**
* **ASK QUESTIONS!**
* **The kid who seems to know everything probably thinks you’re the kid who knows everything**
