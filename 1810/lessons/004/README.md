# First debugging

Today we will practice some elementary debugging, getting to know some of the tools provided to us by our IDEs and some principles of debugging.

Please create a VS or xcode console program project. Make sure you place the project in an easy to access directory. This is particularly true for xcode which would prefer to bury the project so deeply that the phrase "where the sun don't shine" is appropriate.

In both cases, the IDE will create a Hello World source code file.
