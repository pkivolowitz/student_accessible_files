# Lesson 003 - Improvised

## Social Security

Beginning where we left off last class - you would have been adding a feature to the ages program.

The feature was print how many of the two people were eligible for Social Security.

If neither, print "Neither person can get Social Security".

If one, print "One person can get Social Security".

If both, print "Both people can get Social Security".

I asked you to note that in the ages program there were direct analogs of each of these.

Were you able to adapt the code?

Let's do this and then we'll take a step back and rethink the solution in two ways starting with what I am guessing your solution will look like.

## Refactoring to make user defined functions

Next we'll **refactor** the program to make use of user defined functions. This will make ```main()``` much cleaner.

We'll talk about why this is a good idea.

## Revisiting some old code - debugging

Create a new xcode or VS project. For xcode, make sure you know where you are putting the project.

Open the terminal and change to the directory for the sample source code file is. Do:

```wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pkivolowitz/student_accessible_files/master/1810/lessons/003/main.cpp```

Then, follow my instructions to get this connected to your project.
