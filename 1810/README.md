# Kivolowitz CSC 1810 Repository

## Syllabus

The syllabus is located [here](./syllabus.md).

Some points worth repeating:

### This course is intended for CS majors and minors

This course is intended for CS majors and minors or those who believe a major or minor might be right for them.

If your wish is to take one and only one CS course, please consider dropping this course and enrolling in CSC 1100. 1100 is a fun course designed for those with no experience who will **not** be going on to additional CS courses.

### C or better is required to advance

A grade of C or better in this course is required to move on to the next required course in the CS introductory sequence.

### Attendance and practice are critical

Coding is exactly like playing sports, playing music or any other endeavor with which requires practice. Don't short change your future career because you **had** to practice your sport. Don't nuke a required course in your major in deference to choir practice.

If you cannot come to class, send me an email letting me know. You do **not** have to give a reason.

### Software kills

Software kills. Always remember that. Code like someone's life depends on it. Take pride in your work and be good at it.

You might say: "Yeah, but I'll never write avionics or medical instrument software"...

**Programmers are new guardians of public safety, the environment and the future of human kind. No joke.**

### Readings in the text count for **a lot**

We use an electronic book (see syllabus for directions on how to get it). It contains embedded exercises for which I receive a time dependent completion report.

## Emphasis about programming projects fighting back

You cannot approach CS projects as you would homework in other subjects.

For example, reading two chapters from the Iliad or Odyssey can be left for the last minute. You can predict how much time the reading will take and can be assured of completing the assignment the night before the reading is due.

This is not the case with CS projects. 

They fight back.

You may make rapid progress and think "This is easy - I'll finish the night before it's due." Wrong. You do not know when a brick wall will smack you in the face.

Start early.

Work steadily.

Without a doubt some of you will disregard this advice. You will tell me about all the reasons you waited till the day before the project is due. I will make my most sympathetic face and shrug my shoulders.
