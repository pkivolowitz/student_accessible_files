### Finally, downloading individual files from this repository

First, decide where you want the downloaded file to go. 

On the Mac, when you enter ```terminal``` you are in your own *home directory*. You will learn how to navigate the directory structure in class.

On Windows, when you enter ```Ubuntu``` you are in your own *home directory*. You will learn how to navigate the directory structure in class.

Once you are "in" the directory you wish the file to be downloaded to, you may use ```wget```.

Here is a sample of downloading one file from this repo. Where it says ```1100``` put in the course number (this term, either 1100 or 1810). Where it says ```syllabus.md``` put in the name of the file you want.

```text
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pkivolowitz/student_accessible_files/master/1100/syllabus.md
```

To download something in the repo's top level directory (such as this README.md), leave out the course number. Example:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pkivolowitz/student_accessible_files/master/README.md
```

You can quickly get the URL of the file to download by navigating to it in a Web browser, then copy the URL and paste it in the terminal after ```wget```.
