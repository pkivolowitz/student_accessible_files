# CSC 1100 Introduction to Computing

## Catalog description

*An introduction to the art and science of computer programming for the student without previous programming experience. Topics covered include the historical development of computing, the basic operating principles of computers, and an introduction to problem solving using one or more high-level computing languages, such as Python.*

## What this course is really about

The catalog language is accurate but doesn't express the potential for fun  this class offers. Our assumption is that this may be the one and only CS course you take here at Carthage College. From this starting place:

- We expect no prior knowledge of programming
- We hope that after taking this course you will be able to write small tools that will be of use in *your* major / minor and / or career
- We hope you might find this so much fun that you might consider taking more CS courses - maybe become a minor or major

## Material covered

We're going to learn to program in a language called Python. 

Python is, in technical terms, pretty chill. It is known for being both gentle and powerful. The (May 2019) [TIOBE Index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) ranks Python as the fourth most popular programming language. There are so many prewritten Python libraries adding to its power that the following image is funny (to computer people):

We will cover:

- Variables, lists and tuples
- Input from and (formatted) output to both the console and files
- If statements
- Looping
- Functions
- Dictionaries
- Classes

and

- Using many prewritten libraries

## Examples drawn from other disciplines or popular culture

We will work in motivating examples chosen from various majors around campus. Examples will be drawn from my (likely incorrect) understanding of things you young persons find fun. There might even be some "maker" hardware projects. I know I personally love software that touches the physical world.

## Approach to learning to program

I tried really hard to think about how I learned to program in the 1970's. Well, it was self-taught. That's not really going to be of much use to you. OK, so later on, how did I *really* accelerate muy learning? 

By reading other people's code and tinker with it. Let's try this approach.

You will receive little programs that you will have to discuss at your table, read up on this or that, then add documentation to the program. Then, there will be some exercises to modify the program. In moderately more advanced lessons, you'll be given a few little programs each of which do a part of a larger program. Then, you'll be responsible for combining the parts into the larger program. Early on, even though one of your jobs is to document the program you are given, I supply extensive discussion. But, as time goes on, I provide less and less instruction - you will have grown in your familiarity with programming as well as how to research what you don't understand.

[Introduction to Python](http://introtopython.org)

There are two incompatible families of Python: 2.x and 3.x. We are studying 3.x. When you consult online references, be wary of differences between the languages. For example:

```python
# Works in Python 2.x only
print 'I love this course'
# Works in both Python 2.x and 3.x
print('I love this course')
```

## Grading

| Activity | Weight |
| -------- | ------ |
| Zybooks readings | 30% |
| Quizzes | 10% |
| Projects (Homework)| 40% |
| Midterm | 10% |
| Final | 10% |
| &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| Attendance (lack of) | -10% |

### Zybooks readings

Our class text is an electronic book that offers interactive exercises. Zybooks provides an instructor powerful reporting tools to measure student performance. Readings in this course have an increased weighting than typical computer science courses.

### Quizzes

There will be weekly short quizzes.

### Homework

Homework will come in the form of readings (graded separately) and some projects. All graded homework is individual effort.

### Midterm and Final

As per usual. You are permitted a notecard (of customary size) if you wish. None of calculators, rulers, compasses, tea leaves or protractors are needed on exams.

### Projects

Projects will begin to be assigned somewhat later in the course, perhaps in week 5 or 6 - let's see how the class goes.

### Attendance (negative percentage?)

I will not award points for attendance. Coming to class is the most basic part of your **job** as a student. I will not reward you for doing what is expected of you. 

I will however, reduce your grade for excessive absence. Upon your 4th absence, 5 basis points of your final grade will be eliminated. Upon your 6th absence, 10 basis points will be subtracted. 

## Use of student projects for in-class learning

It is really important to learn how to locate errors and fix them in your code. Student projects will be chosen after grading to be used in-class for bug-hunting practice. This is definitely definitely definitely not intended as a slight - finding and fixing of bugs is among the most important lessons you can learn. 

## Accomodations

The Carthage Advising Center offers a variety of services and accommodations to students with disabilities, based on appropriate documentation, nature of disability, and academic need. In order to initiate services, students should meet with Diane Schowalter at the start of the semester to discuss reasonable accommodation. After meeting with Diane Schowalter, students in need of accommodations should also speak with individual faculty members from whom accommodations are sought to communicate their needs and make requests in a timely manner. If a student does not request accommodation or provide documentation, the faculty member is under no obligation to provide accommodations. You may contact Diane Schowalter at ext. 5802 or via e-mail at dschowalter1@carthage.edu.

## A note about accessibility

Carthage College strives to make all learning experiences as accessible as possible. If you anticipate or experience academic barriers due to your disability (including mental health, learning disorders and chronic medical conditions), please let me know immediately so that we can privately discuss options.  To establish reasonable accommodations, you also need to register with Diane Schowalter in Learning Accessibility Services (dschowalter1@carthage.edu).


## Concerning learning outcomes

Students may vary in their competency levels of any stated outcome. Students can expect to achieve stated outcomes only if they honor all course policies, attend classes regularly, complete all assigned work in good faith and on time and meet all other course expectations of them as students.

## Possibility of changes made to the course

Please note the above schedule, policies, procedures and assignments in the course are subject to change in the event of extenuating circumstances, by mutual agreement and / or to encourage better student outcomes.

## Academic Success and Health

Good health can help you achieve academic success. The Health and Counseling Center (HCC) supports students by addressing physical, mental, and emotional well-being. All services are free and confidential and are provided by experienced and licensed professionals. Services are available to all full-time, undergraduate students.

## Office hours

I do not post office hours because no matter what I choose them to be, many of you will not be able to make it. What I do instead, I think, is way better.

I strive to keep my Google Calendar up-to-date. You have access to my calendar. Consult it, find an empty spot, set a meeting adding me as a guest and send me an invitation. In this way, I can meet with you when it is convenient for you rather than ask you to conform entirely to my schedule.

To make an appointment use Google Calendar. You have access to it – we all do. Select show co-worker’s schedule and enter pkivolowitz. When my schedule is visible, pick a blank spot. Click on the blank spot you want and enter an informative title and adjust the time carefully. THEN MAKE SURE YOU SEND ME AN INVITATION. Do this by entering my email address where guests are specified. Make sure you click the “send invitation” button shown to you when you’ve saved the meeting.

My office is located in Straz 090.

## About me

I have been devoted to computer science for 45 years (as of Fall, 2019). I've started many businesses (mostly in Visual Effects for Motion Pictures) and have enjoyed some successes like 1.5 Academy Awards (don't get me started). 

This is my 5th year at Carthage. Prior to coming here, I was 10 years at Wisconsin. I am Chair of the Computer Science Department here at Carthage.

I am fanatical about quality and pride-of-craft. You will hear me say it over and over: Software kills. We have a moral and social obligation to code the best we can.

In my copious spare time I write [Zombie novels](https://www.amazon.com/Get-Off-My-Zombie-Novel-ebook/dp/B00DQ26J8G/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_1?keywords=get+off+my+l%40wn&qid=1558140774&s=gateway&sr=8-1-fkmrnull).

Most of what comes out of my mouth is filled with cynicism and, more rarely, humor. I am *never* sarcastic.
